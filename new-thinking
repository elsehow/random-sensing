sensors  /  sensor data    kind of like tarot cards

works by 
  charisma of the sensing modality
  suggestion of the application context
  social signals that device&application transmits to others


ATOM analogy:
  
  device / modality

     GSR   /   EEG   /    HR    /   BREATH   /   

     examples, notes to see how THEY structure
               play on charisma + suggestion

  context

    WORK  /  FRIENDS  /  SCHOOL  /  DATING  /  MAKING FRIENDS


  outcome (more..)

    RELAXED / PEACEFUL / EASY / ....





ties into dissertaiton
  criticizes / raises skepticism about the mechanism with which sensor-driven applications are effective
